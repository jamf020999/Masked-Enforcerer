Here are a series of results that can be used as feedback from a series of tests that were 
made using the model, the results overall presented sattisfying data, that being said there
were a series of inconsistencies, namely that some images which depicted a person using a 
mask wrong were labeled either as with-mask or without-mask, leaving little to no results 
with a mask-weared-incorrect label. Potentially the reason of this is originated from the
dataset itself, given that there are little examples of people wearing a mask incorrectly.

This means that as the dataset feeds data to the model, the model can only make so accurate
evaluations with what its being inputed both from the dataset and the sample images that are
being uploaded.
